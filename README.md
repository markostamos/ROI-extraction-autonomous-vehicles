# ROI-extraction-autonomous-vehicles
A computer vision approach to the extraction of ROI ( region of interest) in videos from a camera mounted on autonomous vehicles.

ROI identification is based on the histogram method described in  
Yi, Xiang, and Bingjian Wang. "Obstacles detection method of vehicles based on image analysis." In 2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion), pp. 1-5. IEEE, 2017.

Hough line transform is used to identify lanes.
